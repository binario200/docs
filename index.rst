Forj documentation
==================
Forj provides software developers with a rapid, flexible and open continuous integration (CI)/ continuous delivery (CD) development platform.
This environment is often referred to as a software forge, even though, at the time the name was invented, the notion of CI and CD was not as prevalent.

Forj provides:

* A collection of pre-integrated continuous integration and delivery tool stacks called blueprints
   * Forj has currently one continuous integration stack which mimics the OpenStack |trade| Open Source project. We look forward to build a Forj community to add many continuous integration stacks to the catalog.
* An orchestration and administration component called *Maestro* which provides a uniform way to provision projects and users as well as manage the forge (backup/restore, monitoring, updates).

See the `Forj web site <http://www.forj.io>`_ for more information, use cases and flows.
